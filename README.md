# pyESPGen
An interface for programmatically generating ESP files for use in the TES4 Construction Set.
This library is primarily useful for overwriting large portions of TES4 game data, and was created as a utility for use in the ongoing development of the TES4 total conversion, OblivionXL. Learn more about OblivionXL at www.oblivionxl.com.

The library currently only supports Enchantments, Weapons and Leveled Item lists.
